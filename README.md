# Platformer
An Untitled Platformer using Lua and LOVE game engine 

A hobby project I'm creating to learn more about game developement. This project is using the Lua programing langauge, and the Love game engine. 
Currently I have only a debugging stage, but once the game logic is complete I hope to add more interactivity such as collectables, enemies, and more
stages for the player to go through.
